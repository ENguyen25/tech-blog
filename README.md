# Technology for Social Good Blog

## Description
As a person who is interested in technology and writing, I decided to develop my own technology blog so I can share my thoughts with the world. This blog allows users to register their own accounts, and once they are logged in, they can post blog content and comment on any post.

For the front-end, I learned how to render HTML with the template engine Handlebars and style with Bulma. For the back-end, I learned how to create API's with Sequelize.
